# Streamline

A minimal Android productivity app for organizing your time-consuming todos, and actually sticking to them. 
Streamline lets you set and track how much time you would like to spend on different tasks. It also organizes them by Eisenhower's method
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#The_Eisenhower_Method).
