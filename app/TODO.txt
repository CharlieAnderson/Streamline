BUG FIXES:

TODO: Fix delay with clock animation in last second before it calls onFinish

TODO: Fix screen rotation from messing everything up

TODO: (Almost done)Make the timers more accurate (be more careful with casting of ints/longs/floats, probably not necessary unless I get nit-picky)

TODO: Maybe cleanup the code/interaction between CustomCountDownTimer and TimerClockFragment so that it is more readable/more modular

MVP FEATURES:

TODO: Add functionality to allow timers to repeat daily, on certain days, or only once (possibly even more options)

TODO: fix the UI / colors of timers/headers/buttons so it looks better

TODO: add editing of timers

TODO: Add comments...

TODO: Implement dragging Timers across whole sections

POSSIBLE FEATURES:

TODO: Make RecyclerView list subsections expandable/collapsible.

TODO: create a voice command function to create timers, or somehow have google assistant able to create timers

TODO: implement a system where app emails you either daily or weekly with stats of all the time you spent on different graphs, kind of like rescuetime or mint
