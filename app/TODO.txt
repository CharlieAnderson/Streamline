TODO: Make RecyclerView list subsections expandable/collapsible.

TODO: Add functionality to allow timers to repeat daily, on certain days, or only once (possibly even more options)

TODO: Maybe add some kind of validation for adding new timer (really only need this for the task name, if I even want it...)

TODO: Make the timers more accurate (be more careful with casting of ints/longs/floats, probably not necessary unless I get nit-picky)

TODO: Maybe cleanup the code/interaction between CustomCountDownTimer and TimerClockFragment so that it is more readable/more modular

TODO: Implement reordering/repositioning of timers with the swipe up/down feature (can already "move" timers with long-press + swipe up/down)

TODO: Add comments...
